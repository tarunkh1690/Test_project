Following metrics need to monitor to avoid downtime and run application productivaly. 
1 - CPU Utilization
2 - Server load
3 - RAM Utilization
4 - Disk stats
5 - File Disciptor
6 - Network Stats
7 - backend server connectivity/ health
8 - SSL certificate expiry 

Most important metric is Server load to identifiy/understand user experience since server has 4 CPU server load should not be 4 or above 4
( means cpu is taking time complete requst and new requests are in waiting state), in such case application might perform slow. We can check
same using top or w command.
